The first time I watched *Arrival*, I almost walked out when Louise (Amy Adams) started her “kangaroo” monologue. *Almost*, because moments later, she did the unthinkable. She debunked the myth herself. Onscreen. I was floored.

It’s funny when I think about how I reacted to the big reveal. At that time, I could barely contain my excitement; I was shifting in my seat like an overstimulated child and mentally replaying that last scene.

As a nerd, I have a low tolerance for [factoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoid). Case in point: the common misconception that “kangaroo” means “I don’t understand” or “I don’t know.” The [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo#Terminology) is far less exciting—“kangaroo” (originally [“kanguroo”](https://kkeutsori.com/2016/12/13/origin-word-kangaroo)) comes from the Guugu Yimithirr word for the animal, *gangurru*.[^1]

Gratuitous falsehoods like this can make me lose interest in an otherwise interesting movie. To be clear, not all forms of poetic license are gratuitous, but the parroting of popular myths usually is, because (a) these myths are seldom essential to the story, and (b) there’s almost always a better way to handle them.[^2] As *Arrival* demonstrates, you can use the myth, then cleverly debunk it.

Why make such a huge deal about this? My problem with factual errors in movies is that [people have trouble telling fact from fiction](https://nautil.us/most-of-the-mind-cant-tell-fact-from-fiction-237537/). Though my views on this and related issues[^3] have grown more libertarian in recent years, I still can’t help thinking that fiction has a responsibility to avoid propagating myths—at least when there’s a simple fix.

Ironically, my other example is from *House*, a TV show notorious for its ridiculous portrayal of medicine (which I nonetheless love with all my heart):

In this scene, House delivers one of his signature simplistic, specious insights about human nature to make a point but then immediately acknowledges that it may not be true. This (otherwise rare) display of intellectual humility really brings out the cynicism that he’s known for. It adds to the story rather than detracting from it.

To sum up, if you can’t resist the temptation of using a cool-sounding apocryphal story in a work of fiction (or nonfiction), please have the courtesy to mention that it’s not true. As *Arrival* and *House* have shown, there are cool ways of doing that, too.

[^1]: Guugu Yimithirr is also known for using [absolute spatial terms](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227639581_Guugu_Yimithirr_Cardinal_Directions) (north, south, etc.) to the exclusion of body-relative directions (left, right, etc.), which apparently gives its speakers exceptional spatial awareness.

[^2]: I wouldn’t say no to higher standards for historical and factual accuracy in movies, however. [Too many a biopic](#historical-accuracy-in-movies) has bent the truth for cheap tears and profit.

[^3]: For example, whether violent video games should be allowed to exist if there’s a possibility that they lead to real-life violence.
