The war on wokeness may have advanced to greener pastures in recent years, but with no end in sight, I thought now would be as good a time as any to wrap up this essay, six years after I started it.

The spark for writing this was [this question on Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-do-Spanish-speakers-feel-about-the-term-Latinx-a-gender-neutral-alternative-to-Latino). If you go through the responses, you’ll find that they range from “it’s disrespectful to the Spanish language” to “I used to oppose the death penalty until I came across this term.” This animosity toward “Latinx” is shared even by many who accept non-binary gender identities, which makes it somewhat unique as far as culture wars go.

There’s no question that “Latinx” makes little sense in Spanish. Most Romance languages today, including Spanish, have two “genders,” masculine and feminine.[^1] Nouns, pronouns, articles, and adjectives must all agree in gender. If you want to have **latinx* as a gender-neutral word, you must invent a whole new grammatical category.

Thankfully, there’s no need to think too hard to get a sense of what that would be like. Just look at the state of neopronouns in English. How many proponents of gender-neutral language use them? According to The Trevor Project, [only about four percent of young LGBT people do](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/research-briefs/pronouns-usage-among-lgbtq-youth/). In other words, only one in 25 of those *in the vanguard of the movement* choose to refer to themselves as “ze/zir” (also spelled “xe/xir”) or one of the many far less popular alternatives. To most, neopronouns are too alien to use.

You see a similar picture when you look at [attitudes toward “Latinx”](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/09/12/latinx-awareness-has-doubled-among-u-s-hispanics-since-2019-but-only-4-percent-use-it/) among Hispanics in the U.S. Some are in favor, many are indifferent, and about as many are actively against. Coincidentally, just four percent of those surveyed said they’ve used “Latinx” to describe themselves. I surmise that the number of people who use it in Spanish—especially in speech—is a minuscule fraction of that figure. In practice, the need for a matching set of articles, pronouns, and adjective endings limits its applicability to simple declarations like “soy latinx” (“I’m Latinx”).

Then there’s the matter of pronunciation. English allows complex sound sequences and has no problem playing fast and loose with spelling. As a result, /ləˈtinɛks/ *luh-TEE-nex*, by analogy with Latino/Latina, comes quite naturally to English speakers.[^2]

It’s less obvious how this term should be pronounced in Spanish, given its [shallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_depth) orthography and aversion to syllable-final consonant clusters. Spanish does have words like *ápex* and *córtex*, thus “latínex” is a valid vocalization of *latinx*, though for a common word it has an unusual structure.[^3] Both *ápex* and *córtex* are specialized terms with more conventional alternatives, *ápice* and *corteza*.[^4]

These are legitimate reasons for avoiding *latinx* in Spanish: it’s grammatically unwieldy and aesthetically displeasing. But there is another contention that is often brought up in discussions of “woke language.” It goes like this: English speakers have no right to force their values on a language that is not theirs, and their continued attempts to do so amount to “linguistic imperialism.”[^5]

It’s natural to feel sympathetic to this claim, but I’m not convinced. If an outsider has a point about the internal affairs of a group, does it matter that they’re an outsider? The rational answer is that only the content of the argument matters, [not the person making it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem). In the case of “Latinx,” it may well be that the argument is flawed, but for most people, even informed opinions by outsiders can be difficult to stomach.

There is another point to consider, a flip side to the linguistic imperialism argument that is easy to miss when you’re not careful with definitions. Perhaps English speakers have no right to impose *latinx* on the Spanish-speaking world, but “Latino” is not a Spanish word. “Latino” is an *English* word of Spanish *origin*.[^6] And remaking one’s own language is not imperialism.

The confusion is understandable, as the two words look alike and denote the same thing. Communication would be intolerably slow if you paused to dissect every unit of speech. But if you did, it would quickly become evident that there’s a Spanish word *latino* and an English word “Latino.” I’ve made a point of distinguishing the two using italics and quotation marks, but that’s not strictly necessary; even on the surface they are unmistakably distinct.[^7]

For one, Spanish writes racial and ethnic categories, including *latino*, in lowercase. English, meanwhile, treats “Latino” as a proper noun and tends to capitalize it. Grammatically they’re not the same either. *Latino* and *latina* can be seen as inflected forms of one abstract word (lexeme), whereas in English they’re independent roots. The pronunciation differs too. Differences like these emerge when a foreign word is assimilated into a language, which is to say, when it becomes a word in that language. Clearly, “Latino” has joined the ranks of “[mosquito](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mosquito),” “[armadillo](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/armadillo),” and countless other Spanish borrowings in English.

In this light, it’s hard to see why the emergence of “Latinx” as a replacement for “Latino” should be treated differently from any other recent gender inclusivity effort. “Latino” is an English word and hence not untouchable, even if it’s based (as many have claimed) on a misunderstanding of the source language, where the masculine is traditionally used for mixed groups and for referents of unknown gender. The same “misunderstanding” hasn’t stopped English from abandoning its own historically generic masculine terms such as “policeman” in favor “police officer.”

That is why I find it absurd to condemn “Latinx” as “disrespectful to the Spanish language.” It’s no more disrespectful to Spanish than the genericization of the historically masculine “actor” is to Middle French or Latin. Evidently, the greater hostility toward “Latinx” is in part due to its recent coinage, which is a rather superficial reason to attack it. The utility of words is not determined by their vintage.

Again, that *latinx* is too cumbersome to use in Spanish is hard to disagree with. What this doesn’t explain is why “Latinx” shouldn’t be used in English. When you distinguish the English word from its source, it’s unclear why the rules of Spanish word-building should apply; indeed it might even be seen as imperialism. “Latinx” may not win any medals for elegance but it serves a need, is pronounceable, and doesn’t break English grammar.

I will add that I don’t think the desire for inclusive language is the result of misunderstanding. Instead, it comes from a place of indignation. Its proponents are aware of the male-as-default linguistic tradition; they simply reject it. I wouldn’t say this sentiment is unreasonable.

In spite of everything I’ve said, I’m no fan of “Latinx” myself. I tend to stick with “Latino” and “Latinos” for gender-indeterminate and mixed-gender antecedents in both languages (“Latinos and Latinas” feels rather clunky). It’s not so much a principled stand against neologisms as a consequence of my broader view on language reform: that the payoff doesn’t justify the effort. Like many other naïve social justice initiatives, language reform can be actively counterproductive because of the immense antagonism it creates. To me, this makes it a bad investment.

That said, if someone asked to be referred to as “Latinx,” I’d respect it. I’m less sure about Spanish, but as an English word, I think it’s alright. I don’t have strong feelings about it, and I assume most people who self-label as such mean well. It doesn’t seem worth bickering over.

[^1]: For most animate nouns in Spanish, grammatical gender agrees with the natural gender of the referent. So while it’s tempting to try to sidestep the issue of language reform by pointing to exceptions like *persona* and *víctima* or invoking “[noun classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_class),” I think “gender” is the right term, and it’s understandable that someone who doesn’t identify as either male or female might feel excluded.

[^2]: After all, English speakers will look at a word like “[SCSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI)” and decide it’s “scuzzy,” because why not. Of course, not everyone is in agreement about how to pronounce “Latinx.” I’ve heard “Latin X” from quite a few people, and I can imagine others rhyming it with “larynx.”

[^3]: The more agreeable phonotactics of “latinequis” (“latínequis”?) don’t make up for how outlandish it is.

[^4]: Words that end in ⟨x⟩ in Latin typically have ⟨z⟩ or ⟨c(e)⟩ in Spanish (both pronounced /θ/ or /s/), as they were inherited from the Latin [accusative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accusative_case), e.g., *matriz* < *mātrīcem*, *ápice* < *apicem*. Likewise, Greek loans with word-final ⟨x⟩ usually end with ⟨g(e)⟩ or ⟨c(e)⟩, reflecting their Latin conjugation, e.g., *falange* < *phalangem* (accusative of *phalanx*), *hélice* < *helicem* (accusative of *helix*). ⟨x⟩ still represents the cluster /ks/ but tends to reduce to /s/ in casual speech, turning “latínex” into “latines,” which sounds like a name or the plural of [*latine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latine).

[^5]: A counterargument I’ve come across is that Latin American Spanish is itself the legacy of imperialism and thus fair game for reform. This line of reasoning is of course unsound—two wrongs don’t make a right. Conveniently, however, the majority of indigenous languages still spoken in Latin America happen to lack grammatical gender, leaving Spanish and Portuguese the only ones in need of reform.

[^6]: The actual origins of “Latino” are somewhat murky, but it appears to be an American-made abbreviation of the Spanish word *latinoamericano* (possibly influenced by “Afro-” and “Anglo-”). In any case, its usage as a racial designation is largely confined to the U.S.; Latin Americans overwhelmingly prefer to identify themselves using their country of origin (Mexican, Chilean, etc.).

[^7]: What I’ve done is akin to indexing in [general semantics](https://generalsemantics.org/Frequently-Asked-Questions). The theoretical foundations of general semantics may be shaky, but I find many of its observations about language to be insightful and accurate (e.g., the [map–territory distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation)).
