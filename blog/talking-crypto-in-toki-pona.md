While the usual way to introduce proper names into [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona) is to transcribe them, semantic loans are [officially classier](https://jan-ne.github.io/tp/tpize). I thought I’d create some for popular cryptocurrencies.

Let’s start with the word “cryptocurrency” itself. How do we translate such a big word? No need to think twice. What’s the most salient thing about crypto today? It’s crazy volatile. So what’s it going to be? Obviously *mani nasa*—“crazy money.”

(When this stops being true, I assume widespread adoption of crypto will follow, and we’ll just call it *mani* then.)

With that out of the way, we can move on to individual cryptocurrencies. For each one, I’m providing pure Toki Pona translations as well as a phonetic transcription. (Note that I’m using *mani* rather than *mani nasa* as the [head noun](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/Names) in the latter case since there’s no room for confusion with traditional currencies.)

| Cryptocurrency | Toki Pona name | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bitcoin | mani nasa jelo | “yellow/golden cryptocurrency” |
|  | mani nasa pi nanpa wan | “first/#1 cryptocurrency” |
|  | mani Pikowin | A more elegant but less recognizable alternative is *Piko*. I recommend *Pikowin* for clarity. |
| Ether | mani nasa kon | “air/ether cryptocurrency” |
|  | mani nasa pi [kiwen pimeja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ethereum_logo.svg) | “black rock/diamond cryptocurrency” |
|  | mani Isa | “Ethereum” technically only refers to the blockchain. The coin is called “Ether.” |
| Dogecoin | mani nasa pi [soweli suwi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Inu) | “cute critter crypto” |
|  | mani nasa pi [mije nasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) |  |
|  | mani Tosi |  |
| Shiba Inu | mani nasa sin pi soweli suwi | “new cute critter crypto” |
|  | mani Sipa |  |
| Monero | mani nasa [Epelanto](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monero#Esperanto) | “Esperanto cryptocurrency” |
|  | mani Monelo |  |
| Cardano | mani nasa pi [mije sona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano) |  |
|  | mani nasa pi [akesi pi moku akesi](https://cardano.org/ouroboros/) | Alternative translation: *akesi linja sike*. |
|  | mani Katano |  |

I was having too much fun doing these so I decided to try my hand at common crypto jargon next. Here we go:

| Term | Toki Pona translation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stablecoin | mani pi nasa lili | “less crazy money” |
| altcoin | mani nasa pi jelo ala | “non-yellow cryptocurrency” |
|  | mani nasa ante | “other cryptocurrency” |
| HODL | insa | The intended meaning is something like “to hold in your heart”; *jo insa* might be more explicit. |
| whale | monsuta | “behemoth” |
|  | kala suli | “big aquatic animal” |

Of course, no absurdly niche linguistic guide that nobody asked for would be complete without examples:

| Sentence | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| tenpo ala la mi esun sin e mani nasa pi soweli suwi anu mani nasa sin pi soweli suwi!!! | Never buying Doge or SHIB again!!! |
| jan ante li ken ala sona la mani Monelo li mani nasa pi jelo ala pi pona nanpa wan. | Monero is the best altcoin in terms of privacy. |
| ale li pona. o insa e mani nasa sina! | Don’t worry, HODL! |

And that’s a wrap. Next up: a complete Toki Pona translation of [*Molecular Biology of the Cell*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_Biology_of_the_Cell_(book)). Until then, *o tawa pona*.
