As of 2025, I’ve seen over seven hundred movies and TV shows. Among them, there are maybe 50 that I consider masterpieces, another hundred or so that I would recommend, two hundred that are sufferable but nothing to write home about, and many more nearly unwatchable 1s and 2s.

I don’t really think about this last category. I had no expectations when I watched them and I wasn’t emotionally invested.

Still, there is one (widely beloved) movie in that category that I’m actively hostile to: *The Imitation Game*. When I’m unlucky enough to be reminded of it, I inevitably launch into an imaginary argument where I fulminate against its countless crimes for half an hour before ransacking the refrigerator to recharge.

Today I thought I’d fulminate productively at least and finally write some of it down. *The Imitation Game* does [many things](https://slate.com/culture/2014/12/the-imitation-game-fact-vs-fiction-how-true-the-new-movie-is-to-alan-turings-real-life-story.html) wrong, but the one I want to highlight is the film’s depiction of Turing’s personality.

*The Imitation Game* is meant to be a biography of Alan Turing, the great English mathematician and cryptanalyst. But its protagonist, though masterfully played by Benedict Cumberbatch, feels like someone else.

The “feel” of a movie or written work is hard to relay in words, although the concept itself is easy to describe. It’s the whole that emerges from the sum of the parts—the form and the content—in the mind of the beholder.

Crucially, the feel is as much a function of the intrinsic properties of the work as of the beholder. You can get all the facts right and still end up with a result that *feels* different from what you intended.

For example, while writing this essay, there were many times where, upon rereading what I wrote, I had to go back and rework parts of it because my original point had been lost. The *feel* of my written argument, the *mental representation* induced by reading it, differed from the one in my head.[^1]

It’s for this reason that *The Imitation Game* failed to resonate with me. To me, the real Turing and the fictional Turing are so unlike that they map to different loci in my mind. Chances are, you’ll end up with the same impression if you (re)watch the movie, then read any biography of Turing’s life. This is not a given, of course, but it seems likely given how many have remarked on the film’s inaccuracies.

While I would generally insist that almost any deviation from the facts is unacceptable in a biographical drama, I’d be willing to settle for a weaker claim. Two claims, to be precise:

1. Artistic license in a biographical film’s reproduction of the events or characters is harmful when it fundamentally alters how they’re perceived.
2. The deliberate or accidental misrepresentation of historical or scientific facts is [always wrong](#favorite-scenes), in any work of fiction.

For instance, in one of the [most memorable scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIad8SAv1zg) of the movie, Turing’s team decides to sacrifice codebreaker [Peter Hilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hilton)’s (fictional) brother to keep their success in breaking the Nazi code a secret. Heartwrenching? Yes. Completely fabricated? Of course. But it’s a largely irrelevant detail and therefore passes the first test, if only by a whisker.

On the other hand, Turing’s [apparent autism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I2cu6h7Ycs) doesn’t. And [his mental and physical state post–hormone treatment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXkGh9yT63c) fails both tests, since it’s a scientifically bogus conceit designed to muster sympathy for the film’s tragic hero, a cheap tactic—far from the only one—to sell an otherwise mediocre biopic.

Speculative fiction is naturally exempt from this burden, provided that the distortion is essential to the plot and not merely the result of a lack of due diligence. *Doctor Who* is science fantasy based on the premise of time travel, so it’s in the clear. *Cryptonomicon* also fictionalizes details of Turing’s life, but it’s expressly a work of alternate history.

*The Imitation Game* is not. It bills itself as the true story of the “man who cracked the code.” And yet, the “Turing” in *The Imitation Game* is nothing more than the stock character of the socially awkward tragic genius dressed up as a popular historical figure. As a result, *The Imitation Game* comes across as a WWII thriller using Turing’s name as a selling point.
